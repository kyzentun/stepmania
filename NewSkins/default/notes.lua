	-- A state_map tells Stepmania what frames to use for the quantization of
	-- a note and the current beat.
	-- First, Stepmania goes through the list of quanta in the state map to
	-- find the one that fits how far the note is from directly on the beat.
	-- Stepmania uses the per_beat field in the quantum to pick which one to
	-- use.
	-- Secondly, Stepmania finds the state in the quantum for the current beat.
	-- The vivid flag is used here to allow vivid noteskins to make different
	-- quantizations start at different points in the animation.
	-- In code, it uses this formula:
	--   if vivid then
	--     state_index= floor((quantization + beat) * #entry)
	--   else
	--     state_index= floor(beat * #entry)
	--   end
	-- The index is then wrapped so that quantization 0.75 + beat 0.75
	-- doesn't go off the end of the entry.
	-- Long explanation:
	--   Each quantization has a set of frames that it cycles through.  The
	--   current beat is used to pick the frame.  For vivid noteskins, the
	--   quantization is added to the beat to pick the frame.  If
	--   quantization+beat is greater than 1, it is shifted to put it between
	--   0 and 1.
	--   The frames are spaced equally through the beat.
	--   If there are two frames, the first frame is used while the beat is
	--   greater than or equal to 0 and less than 0.5.  The second frame is
	--   used from 0.5 to 1.
	-- This example has 8 quantizations.
	-- tap_state_map is for convenience making the noteskin.  Each
	-- NewSkinPart in each column is allowed to have its own state map, to allow
	-- them to animate differently, but that is usually not desired.
	-- Each quantization occurs a given number of times per beat.
	-- They must be arranged in ascending order of times per beat for the
	-- correct quantization to be assigned.
	-- The states element is a list of frames to use for animating the tap when
	-- it has the given quantization.
	-- If the per_beat field of a quantum is not a factor of parts_per_beat, it
	-- will not be used.
	-- The last entry in quanta will be used for parts that don't fit a known
	-- quantization.
	-- parts_per_beat must be the lowest common multiple of the per_beat fields
	-- of the quanta.  If parts_per_beat is not the lowest common multiple, the
	-- quanta that it is not a multiple of will be ignored.
